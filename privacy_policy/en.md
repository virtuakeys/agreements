Google has its own data protection measures, and you can find details on the Google Data Protection Terms page: https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprservices/. You can reject the use of your location data from the product settings, in which case we will stop collecting and using your location data.

   To prevent your personal data from being processed unlawfully and to ensure that your personal data is securely stored, all necessary technical and administrative measures are taken to ensure the appropriate level of security. VirtuaKeys employs various security strategies to ensure the data security of its users and services. For device access, VirtuaKeys uses suitable algorithms for data protection, access verification, and approval. For data transmission, commercial-grade data encryption based on security algorithms, transmission encryption protocols, and dynamic keys are supported. For data processing, strict data filtering, verification, and data auditing are in place. For data storage, all confidential user data will be encrypted.

9. **Data Storage**

   In line with the purposes specified in the Privacy Agreement, unless there is a legal regulation requiring us to retain your data for a longer period, your data will be stored for the periods specified in the VirtuaKeys Retention and Disposal Policy. We determine the retention period based on the amount, nature, and sensitivity of your Personal Data.

If we are unable to do this for technical reasons, appropriate measures will be taken to prevent the use of your Personal Data.

10. **Children's Privacy**

    Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. The Services we provide are not intended for individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we request that these individuals do not share their Personal Data with us. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from anyone under the age of eighteen (18) without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from an individual under the age of eighteen (18) without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, we will take the necessary steps to remove that data.
